    question: "How It Works",
    answer: "Steps: Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the process from the initial consultation to the tattoo session and aftercare:\n\n" +
      "1. Initial Consultation: We begin with a consultation to discuss your ideas, preferences, and the design you want. This can be done in person or online.\n\n" +
      "2. Design Creation: Based on our discussion, I will create a custom design for your tattoo. We will review and refine the design until you are completely satisfied.\n\n" +
      "3. Scheduling the Session: Once the design is finalized, we will schedule the tattoo session at a time that is convenient for you.\n\n" +
      "4. Tattoo Session: On the day of your appointment, I will ensure that you are comfortable and understand the process. The tattoo will be applied with great care and precision.\n\n" +
      "5. Aftercare Instructions: After the tattoo is done, you will receive detailed aftercare instructions to ensure proper healing and to maintain the quality of your new tattoo.\n\n" +
      "6. Follow-Up: We may schedule a follow-up appointment to check the healing process and touch up any areas if necessary."

    question: "Can I get a tattoo if I have certain medical conditions?",
